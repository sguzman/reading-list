# Reading List

A log of what books I plan on reading next

## Profile

Follow me on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58613987-salvador-guzman) to see what I'm reading and what I've read.

## Executive Summary

This is my ad-hoc reading list. I'm not sure how often I'll update it, but I'll try to keep it up to date. These are the books I plan on reading next. The order is more tentative than anything else.

### Content

The books will generally of an intellectual character. Not necessarily hard-core mathematics (although those too) but anything that catches my eye. I will try to aim towards relevance to modern day issues, but I will also try to read the classics. I will also try to read books that are relevant to my career, but I will also try to read books that are relevant to my personal life.

Eventually I will seek out political books. I feel that politics is a domain where there is woefully little reference to the theoretical literature. I do not mean to say that political commentary needs to be deferred to but it should be engaged with in some capacity.

### Duplicate Books

As is evinced by my prolific reading history, some of the books I will put to read, I have already consumed in my spare time. I do not mind rereading some classics because they merit the opportunity of a second perusal. Receiving this chance to read them again for an audience; I consider this a plus :).

### Roadmap

I plan on streaming myself reading them on my youtube channel, found [here](https://www.youtube.com/@ActualGeniusIntellectual). I will read them in excruitiating detail, and will probably take as long as I need to read them. Luckily I use Speechify to read them to me, so I can listen to them at 2x speed.

Streaming them will be my attempt to prove that I have engaged with these pieces of literature in good faith and have consumed everything they have had to say.

### Contributions
